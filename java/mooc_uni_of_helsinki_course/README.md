# Learning Java
> The goal of this section is to learn java, object oriented programming and advanced techniques.
</br>

> The folder `mooc_uni_of_helsinki_course` contains work I did from the [University of Helsinki's Online Java Courses](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/)
</br>

### Important Notes:
- removed test files and miscellaneous provided by the university
- skipped some exercises as they were somewhat unnecessary to do
